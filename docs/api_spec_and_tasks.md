## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the CLI. It should parse the command line arguments and call the appropriate functions in the other modules."),
    ("airdrop.py", "Contains the Airdrop class, which is responsible for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and performing the airdrop."),
    ("database.py", "Contains the Database class, which is responsible for interacting with the SQLite database and storing the history of airdrops."),
    ("models.py", "Contains the SQLAlchemy ORM models for the SQLite database.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "models.py",
    "database.py",
    "airdrop.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'web3.py' library is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows us to connect to local or remote Ethereum nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.

The 'argparse' library is used to create the command line interface for the CLI. It allows us to easily parse command line arguments and automatically generates help and usage messages.

The 'SQLAlchemy' library is used to interact with the SQLite database. It provides a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python, which allows us to easily manipulate data in the database.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, the actual implementation might require additional libraries or tools for interacting with specific EVM chains or for handling specific token types. We need to clarify this before starting the project.
